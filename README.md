Reflection 1 

In this exercise, I implemented two new features in the eShop application using Spring Boot: Edit Product and Delete Product. While working on these features, I tried to apply the clean code practices that were taught in this module. I structured the application using a layered approach by separating the code into controller, service, repository, and model so that each part has a clear responsibility. This made the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. I also used clear and descriptive method names such as create, findAll, and deleteById, which helped make the program flow more intuitive. In terms of security, I avoided hard-coding any sensitive information in the source code and implemented the delete feature using a POST request instead of a GET request to reduce the risk of accidental deletion. A confirmation dialog was also added in the user interface to prevent users from deleting data unintentionally. However, after reviewing the code, I noticed some areas that could be improved. Most of the input validation is currently handled only on the client side through HTML attributes, so adding server-side validation would make the application more robust. Additionally, the application still uses in-memory storage, meaning all data is lost when the application restarts. Using a database with Spring Data JPA would be a better approach for a real-world application. Overall, this exercise helped me better understand how to implement new features in an organized way while being mindful of code quality and basic security considerations.
